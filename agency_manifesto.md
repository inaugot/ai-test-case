# EComAgency Manifesto

## Mission
Our mission is to automate the process of generating and validating test cases for an e-commerce platform. We aim to ensure that the generated test cases are of high quality and meet the functional requirements specified by the user.

## Goals
1. Generate accurate and comprehensive test cases based on the provided feature document or functional specs.
2. Validate the generated test cases through a QA engineer.
3. Separate valid and invalid test cases based on a threshold score.
4. Provide the user with a clear view of valid and invalid test cases.

## Working Environment
The agency operates in a collaborative environment where each agent has a distinct role but works towards a common goal. Communication between agents is facilitated through synchronous messaging to ensure smooth coordination and task execution.

## Functionalities to Cover
1. User browsing the site and adding products to the cart.
2. User adding a valid address and payment method on the checkout page.
3. Checkout page displaying all order and payment summary with taxes and discounts.
